Whitehead's theorem in HoTT
============================

This library contains a small, customized version of Andrew Swan's [branch](https://github.com/awswan/HoTT-Agda/tree/agda-2.6.1-compatible) of the HoTT-Agda library. We have checked the code with Agda 2.6.3.

The purpose of this library is a modern mechanized proof of Whitehead's theorem
for truncated types in the style of Book HoTT. Such a proof is in the directory
`HoTT-Agda/theorems/`. This proof is based on and updates Dan Licata's old
hott-agda proof (dated Jul 9, 2014), found at

  https://github.com/dlicata335/hott-agda/blob/master/homotopy/Whitehead.agda
